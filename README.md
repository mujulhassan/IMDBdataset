IMDBdataset

The IMDB dataset is a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet movie database. These reviews are split into two, 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing with each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews. 

This dataset uses separate training and test sets because you should never test a machine learning model on the same data that you used to train it, as it could perform very differently on data that has not yet been seen. Therefore you care about a models performance on new data.

Hypothesis
- The outputs can be predicted given the inputs
- The available data is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs
